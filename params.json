{"name":"Raddle","tagline":"Extensible Document Manipulation Language for the Web","body":"## What is Raddle?\r\n\r\nRaddle is a rad new language for manipulating structured documents on the web. It is [fully-featured](#fully-featured), [functional](#functional), [point-less](#point-less), [URL-encodable](#url-encodable), [type-safe](#type-safe) and completely [free](#free) (as in speech).\r\n\r\n### Fully-featured\r\n\r\nThe Raddle core implements the entire W3C XPATH 3.0 specification and then some.\r\n\r\n### Functional\r\n\r\nRaddle has all the good things from functional programming, including respect for [immutability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), [higher-order functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function), [abstraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29) and [referential transparency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_%28computer_science%29).\r\n\r\n### Point-less\r\n\r\nYou can't declare variables in Raddle, as you won't need them.\r\n\r\n### URL-encodable\r\n\r\nRaddle is inspired by RQL, and has the same notation. If you're already familiar with RQL you can start hacking right away.\r\n\r\n### Type-safe\r\n\r\nWith Raddle's type declarations, types are kept in check.\r\n\r\n### Free\r\n\r\nRaddle is licensed under the AFL or BSD license.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Raddle's Genesis\r\n\r\nRaddle was inspired by RQL. RQL is a great tool for querying JSON, but with Raddle you can extend that greatness! It is capable of handling more types than arrays of objects, and you can add new functionality, either inline or from external modules.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Raddle encourages implementation in other languages, as its core definitions are clear and concise from the start.\r\n\r\n## Raddle's TODO\r\n\r\n* Implement Raddle's core functions in Javascript, XQuery, Java, PHP, Scala, Ruby, Perl, Python, C++, et cetera!\r\n* Make Raddle compatible with Dojo's [dstore](https://github.com/sitepen/dstore).\r\n* Use Raddle to manipulate the browser's DOM.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
