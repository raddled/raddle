{"name":"Raddle","tagline":"Extensible Query Language for the Web","body":"# Raddle\r\nExtensible Document Manipulation Language for the Web\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/wshager/raddled.git for definition files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's this?\r\n\r\nRaddle is a rad new language for manipulating structured documents on the web. It is [fully-featured](#user-content-fully-featured), [functional](#user-content-functional), [point-less](#user-content-point-less), [URL-encodable](#user-content-URL-encodable), [type-safe](#user-content-type-safe) and free as beer.\r\n\r\n### Fully-featured\r\n\r\nThe Raddle core implements the entire W3C XPATH 3.0 specification and then some.\r\n\r\n### Functional\r\n\r\nRaddle has all the good things from functional programming, including respect for [immutability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), [higher-order functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function), [abstraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29) and [referential transparency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_%28computer_science%29).\r\n\r\n### Point-less\r\n\r\nYou can't declare variables in Raddle, as you won't need them.\r\n\r\n### URL-encodable\r\n\r\nRaddle is inspired by RQL, and has the same notation. If you're already familiar with RQL you can start hacking right away.\r\n\r\n### Type-safe\r\n\r\nWith Raddle's type declarations, types are kept in check.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why's this?\r\n\r\nRQL is a great tool for querying JSON, but with Raddle you can extend that greatness! It is capable of handling more types than arrays of objects, and you can add new functionality, either inline or from external modules.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Raddle encourages implementation in other languages, as its core definitions are clear and concise from the start.\r\n\r\n## What's to do?\r\n\r\n* Implementating Raddle's core functions in Javascript, XQuery, Java, PHP, Scala, Ruby, Perl, Python, C++, et cetera!\r\n* Making Raddle compatible with Dojo's [dstore](https://github.com/sitepen/dstore).\r\n* Use Raddle to manipulate the browser's DOM.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
